    //Python inherits attributes from ProgrammingLanguage but it behaves like an OOP.    
    //After doing some research I have come to the conclusion that a coder should use Interfaces for defining certain behaviors such as OOP and that 
    //Abstract classes should be used to create default or general properties and methods for other classes to build upon such as the Duck class in the book Head First Design.
    //The book used Interfaces to define certain behaviors such as flyingBehavior and quackingBehavior for different types of ducks.
    //Concrete classes are the only classes that can be instantiated.
    //I would use Concrete classes for instantiation.  Concrete classes should implement Abstract classes and implement Interfaces to instantiate unique classes.
